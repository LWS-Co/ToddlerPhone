SafePass ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the SafePass mobile application (the ‚ÄúApp‚Äù).

1. Information We Do Not Collect
We do not collect, store, or share any personal data from our users. Specifically:

We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or other personal identifiers.

We do not access your contacts, location, messages, or other sensitive information.

Images saved in folders within the app remain entirely on your device and are not uploaded or shared with any server or third party.

2. Permissions Used
To function as intended, SafePass requests the following permissions:

Camera Access: To allow users to take photos of documents directly within the app.

Storage Access: To save and retrieve images from your local device storage.

These permissions are used solely to enhance your experience and are not used for data collection.

3. In-App Ads (If AdMob Is Used)
We may display banner ads provided by Google AdMob. These ads may use anonymized device identifiers (such as the advertising ID) to serve relevant ads. Please refer to Google's Privacy & Terms for more information on how they manage data.

4. App Pinning and Secure Mode
SafePass provides a secure view mode using Android‚Äôs screen pinning feature. This is purely a local device function and does not transmit or share any data.

5. Third-Party Services
We do not integrate third-party analytics or user tracking services.

If you use features involving third-party components (e.g., Google AdMob for ads), they are governed by their own privacy policies.
