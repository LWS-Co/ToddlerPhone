This ToddlerPhone app (“we”, “us”) cares about your privacy.  

**Data We Collect**  
- **Audio recordings**: Only if you opt to record your own voice (stored locally).  
- **Phone state**: Used to detect when a real call ends so fake calls stop.  
- **Advertising identifiers**: We use AdMob to serve ads; Google collects ad IDs per their policy.

**How We Use Data**  
- To enable/disable live vs. fake calling.  
- To play back your recorded voice.  
- To display personalized ads via AdMob.

**Data Sharing**  
- We do **not** share your recordings or phone number with third parties.  
- AdMob’s SDK may collect device identifiers; see Google’s [Privacy & Terms](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).

**Your Choices**  
- You can delete your recorded voice in Settings.
